        | Here are a number of projects I built while completing the Team Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree. Each project introduces new skills and problems to solve, so it has been a great way to build upon my knowledge of both front end and back end technologies. This portfolio site is a project in itself and a means to showcase the hard work I have put into my personal development.
