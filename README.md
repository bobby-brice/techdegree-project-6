# techdegree-project-6

Static Node.js and Express Personal Portfolio Site

Here are a number of projects I have built while completing the Team Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree. Each project introduces new skills and problems to solve, so it has been a great way to build upon my knowledge of both front end and back end technologies. This portfolio site is a project in itself and a means to showcase the hard work I have put into my personal development.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project files

### Prerequisites

In the command line, run: 
``` 
npm init 
```
to setup a package.json file

install express using: 
```
npm install express --save
```
install pug using: 
```
npm install pug --save
```
install typed.js to get the typing text effect
```
npm install typed.js
```
Optional
 Nodemon is installed to autorefresh the server after changes using:
 ```
 npm install nodemon --save
```
To make the project more unique, I added box shadow to the project containers, imported 'Raleway' from google fonts, and add a professional logo.
